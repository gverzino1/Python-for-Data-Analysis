Recommender Systems 

A full recommender system requires a heavy linear algebra background. 

There are two types of systems:
    Collaborative Filtering (CF) -- Produces recommendations based on the knowledge of users attitudes to items (wisdom of the crowd). Filters based on USER preferences.
    Content-based -- Focus on attributes of the items and give recommendations based on the similiarity between them. Filters based on ITEM similarities.
    
    
CF is more common. Better results. Easy to understand. The algorithm can do feature learning on its own, so it can begin to learn for itself what features to use.
    Memory-Based -- performed by computing cosine similarity
    Model-Based -- performed using singular value decomposition
