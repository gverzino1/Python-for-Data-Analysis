K means is unsupervised learning algorithm. It attempts to group similar clusters together.

For example:
    Cluster similar documents
    Cluster customers based on features
    Identify similar physical groups
    
Goal: Divides data into distinct groups.
How: 
    1. Choose a number of clusters "K"
    2. Then assign each point to a specific cluster (theyll still be together)
    3. Then cluster centroids are computed, which will be overlapping at first because the initial cluster assignments were choosen at random
    4. Each observation will then be assigned to the nearest centroid
    5. Then the cluster centroids are moved to the observation groups

Determining "K": Use the "elbow method":
Compute the sum of squared error (SSE) for some values of K, which is the SSE between K its centroid. If you plot K against SSE, youll see the error decreases as K gets larger. The "elbow method" chooses a K at which SSE decreases abruptly, or where the SSE is "mostly" reduced and any further increase in K doesnt improve your cluster assignment.
